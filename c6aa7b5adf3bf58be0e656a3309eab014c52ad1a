      "message": "I might be late to the party, but I\u0027m wondering why the Tycho sources are not using final modifiers for method argument in this complete file. That would have prohibited such a re-assignment, which is a bad practice (independent of whether it causes an actual error like here).\n\nShould we try to have the JDT preferences for Tycho changed to * throw an error when re-assigning a method argument\n* add \"final\" to method arguments as safe action\n?",
