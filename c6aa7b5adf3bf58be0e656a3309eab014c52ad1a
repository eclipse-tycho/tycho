      "message": "I might be late to the party, but I\u0027m wondering why the Tycho sources are not using final modifiers for method argument in this complete file. That would have prohibited such a re-assignment, which is a bad practice (independent of whether it causes an actual error like here).\n\nShould we try to have the JDT preferences for Tycho changed to * throw an error when re-assigning a method argument\n* add \"final\" to method arguments as safe action\n?",

      "message": "I personally don\u0027t like this \"add final to everywhere\", as \u0027final\u0027 on local variables and method parameter has only one impact that they could be used in innerclass/lamdas and java 8 even removed that restriction a while ago when there is no assignment to that variable. So the only effect of this is to bloat the code and make it hard to read.\n\nWhether reassignment is bad or not is arguable in my opinion, I don\u0027t see any reason why this should not be used, method parameters are passed for the sole use in that function, they are local to the function and the final modifier has no impact on the caller (in contrast to C++ for example where \u0027const\u0027 passes a read-only reference).",

I rather believe in distributed projects the coding style should rule out as many potential bugs as possible and remove uncertainties and disambigouties from the language as much as possible.",

      "message": "Reassigning the value of a method parameter is considered a bad practice. But that is opinionated. From my experience it is a cause for bugs and bad readable code. Even static code analysis tools are marking this. So I agree with Michael that such things should be avoided. At least my coding style has changed since I use static code analysis tools and needed to fix issues because of such bad practices. But as I said, it is not an anti-pattern but bad practice that is opinionated.",
