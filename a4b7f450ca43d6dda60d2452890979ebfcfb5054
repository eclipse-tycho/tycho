      "message": "comment rearding the xz compressed repo:\n\nI\u0027m surprised that this works without p2.index.\n\nI thought p2 repos with .xz compression require a p2.index file otherwise p2 will not try to load the xz compressed files (the default used to be only .xml and .jar, but maybe this was changed with Mars).\n\nI may be wrong but the eclipse platform repo uses:\n\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/releases/mars/201510021000/p2.index\n\nwhich has\n\nversion\u003d1\nmetadata.repository.factory.order\u003d content.xml.xz,content.xml,!\nartifact.repository.factory.order\u003d artifacts.xml.xz,artifacts.xml,!\n\nOTOH maybe this is only a performance optimization (changing the order in which p2 should try to download files)\n\nIn our case (xz files only)  we would have\n\nversion\u003d1\nmetadata.repository.factory.order\u003d content.xml.xz,!\nartifact.repository.factory.order\u003d artifacts.xml.xz,!\n\nIn real life, xz compressed repos I saw up to now always also have jar compression (for backwards compat with older p2 clients)\nso if we want this test to be closer to real usage, maybe it\u0027s a good idea to have both xz compressed and jar compressed files and a p2.index similar to the eclipse platform repo above.",
