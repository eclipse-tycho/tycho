I see the need for this in dependency resolution, but I doubt that target definition resolution include this.",

      "message": "Yes, target definition is also being swt fixed but most sane target definitions would already include swt fragments, in which case swt fix is a noop. \n\nI do agree we need to disable swt fix for target files, but this is a separate issue and we should deal with it with a separate bugzilla and git commit. I\u0027ve opened bug 381167 to track this.",
