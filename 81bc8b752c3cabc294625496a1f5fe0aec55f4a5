      "message": "Tycho doesn\u0027t (and AFAIK never did) support POM dependency consider for system scope dependencies. Therefore, we could simply remove all system scope dependencies. This would fix bug 415774.\n\nSuch a code would however be wrong in this method (i.e. should be moved elsewhere). I\u0027m not particularly happy about the architecture of the POM dependency stuff in the P2TargetPlatformResolver code, but I also don\u0027t know how to improve it. Attempting to write a unit test for this (on the Maven classloader side) would probably help. If this is too much effort, we could also just extend one of the integration tests.",

      "message": "BTW, this is also questionable. This code implies that the dependencies use the groupId like cached p2 artifacts. However, this code results in a groupId \"p2.eclipse-plugin\", whereas the corresponding artifact would be cached at the groupId \"p2.osgi.bundle\"",
