# Shared Target location code

This is a C&P of the m2e shared target code unless m2e has an item deployed at maven central. 

If you want to make changes, please *first* apply them to m2e here: 
https://github.com/eclipse-m2e/m2e-core/tree/master/org.eclipse.m2e.pde.target/src/org/eclipse/m2e/pde/target/shared

after it is merged open a corresponding PR for Tycho by simply copy over the file.
