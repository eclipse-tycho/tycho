      "message": "Can you elaborate you concerns? Adding new mojo is trivial but I need to understand the problem before I can comment on a solution.\n\nAll tycho-compatible packaging types already must have corresponding TychoProject implementation, so proposed change does not seem to impede extensibility unless you plan to rework/remove TychoProject in the near future.",
