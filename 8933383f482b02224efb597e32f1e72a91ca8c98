      "message": "Can you elaborate you concerns? Adding new mojo is trivial but I need to understand the problem before I can comment on a solution.\n\nAll tycho-compatible packaging types already must have corresponding TychoProject implementation, so proposed change does not seem to impede extensibility unless you plan to rework/remove TychoProject in the near future.",

      "message": "The vision is to allow others to define new packaging types by picking mojos from the default lifecycle of our packaging types (without having to register a new component). For this to work, we\u0027d need to get a away from the packaging type based reasoning (\"this is packaging type xyz hence I do this\") to a more concern-based reasoning (\"the mojo for an aggregate type is used, therfore...\"). Switching behaviour via different Mojos is a step in that direction.\n\nAnd in unrelated terms, it seems to me that aggregate qualifier computation is significantly different to the standard qualifier computation to justify a separation into mojos.",
