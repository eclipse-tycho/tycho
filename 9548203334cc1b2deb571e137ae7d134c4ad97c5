Should not be a problem on itself.\n\nAnother difference is, instead of fixed memory footprint by reading into same byte[], it will read the whole file, calculate checksum and only then release byte[] (according to JavaDoc, throws OutOfMemoryError - if an array of the required size cannot be allocated, for example the file is larger that 2GB).",
