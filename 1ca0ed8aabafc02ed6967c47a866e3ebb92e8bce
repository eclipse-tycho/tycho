      "message": "Similarly, the goal name shouldn\u0027t include \"platform\" because the validation only covers the target file. How about \"validate-target-file\"?\n\nAlthough the name \"tycho-target-platform-plugin\" is okay (assuming that all the target-platform-configuration will be moved to it eventually), but I am unsure we should really introduce this plugin name already today - having both a tycho-target-platform-plugin and a target-platform-configuration seems confusing. Instead, I\u0027d move the new goal into target-platform-configuration for now.",
