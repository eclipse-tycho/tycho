# Releasing Tycho

This describes the steps to perform a release of Tycho:

## Prerequisites for performing a release

- [ ] Make sure you have everything setup (GPG installed!) for deploying to the Nexus OSS repository, see https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html guide
- [ ] Make sure you have a pgp key and it is published to the key-servers eg. https://keys.openpgp.org/
- [ ] Make sure you have a sonartype account and are allowed to publish for tycho organization
- [ ] Add your credentials for server `sonatype-central-portal` in `~/.m2/settings.xml` (see [here](https://maveniverse.eu/docs/njord/using-it/#setting-it-up) for details)
```xml
<servers>
  <server>
    <id>sonatype-central-portal</id>
    <username>$TOKEN1</username>
    <password>$TOKEN2</password>
    <configuration>
      <njord.publisher>sonatype-cp</njord.publisher>
      <njord.releaseUrl>njord:template:release-sca</njord.releaseUrl>
    </configuration>
  </server>
</servers>
```


## Making a new release for the current stream

- [ ] Make sure all fixed issues and merged PRs have the correct milestone for this release, to finding PRs without milestone you can use the following filter `is:pr is:merged no:milestone base:main` issues without milestone can be found with `is:issue no:milestone is:closed`
- [ ] Review the [release notes](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md) which should provide a quick overview of new features and bug fixes
- [ ] Create branch `tycho-N.M.x` (e.g. `tycho-7.0.x`) for upcoming release and push it to remote; this branch should remain frozen until the release, only major fixes for regressions could be merged in before release. Work can still happen regularly for the following version on the `master` branch.
- [ ] Update the version on the master with `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<next tycho version>-SNAPSHOT` and mention the new release in the [release notes](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md), then publish the changes.
- [ ] Create release record on https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tycho projects.eclipse.org, link the N&N to https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/blob/[branch-name]/RELEASE_NOTES.md release notes]
- [ ] Update the Jenkinsfile on the `tycho-N.M.x` and adjust the `deployBranch` to reference the new created branch
- [ ] Announce the intent to release and request feedback about snapshots on the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/discussions):
```
We plan to release Tycho <VERSION>.

For details of new features and bugfixes, see [release notes](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/blob/tycho-<VERSION>/RELEASE_NOTES.md).

Please help by testing by try out the current [tycho snapshot](https://github.com/eclipse/tycho/wiki#getting-tycho-snapshots) build.

We [plan](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/milestone/<ID OF MILESTONE>) to publish this release <DATE> unless major regressions are found.

Regards,
Tycho team
```

... Wait until release date (usually a week later)...

- [ ] make sure all tags are fetched with `git fetch -t`
- [ ] `git fetch eclipse tycho-N.M.x` to get the branch to be released
- [ ] Update version to remove `-SNAPSHOT` with `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<VERSION>`
- [ ] Update versions in tycho-demo folder
- [ ] `git add * && git commit` version change
- [ ] Deploy to local staging repository (check that the correct pgp key is used and published to the key-servers eg. https://keys.openpgp.org/): 
```
mvn clean deploy -Prelease -DskipTests \
     -DaltDeploymentRepository=id::njord: \
     -Dgpg.keyname=<your e-mail of pgpg key> \
     -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/tycho-release
```
- [ ] review the local staging repo (see [here](https://maveniverse.eu/docs/njord/using-it/#using-it) for details) `mvn njord:list` / `mvn njord:list-content -Dstore=release-xxx`
- [ ] [Publish the staged release](#publish-the-staged-release)
- [ ] `git tag tycho-<VERSION>`
- [ ] [Publish the sitedoc](#publish-the-sitedoc) for the release
- [ ] Update version to the next development version with `mvn org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:set-version -DnewVersion=<NEXT_VERSION>-SNAPSHOT`
- [ ] review, add and commit the changes e.g. with message `Prepare for next version`
- [ ] push the branch
- [ ] push the tag `git push origin tycho-<TYCHO_VERSION>`
- [ ] [Prepare the announcement text](#prepare-the-announcment-text)
- [ ] [Create a Github release](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/releases/new) using the created tag and prepared text
- [ ] Also post this in the release discussion
- [ ] Forward the above text to tycho-dev@eclipse.org
- [ ] Optionally, announce on other medias (Twitter, ...)

## Create a Bugfix Release for an older version stream

Sometimes it is necessary or desired to release a bugfix for an older version stream, e.g. if a new major version is started but not yet released it is usually good to still release critical bugfixes or user provided back-ports.

### Prepare the bugfix release
For a bugfix release there are slightly different steps to perform in the prepare phase

- [ ] Create a release record https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tycho
- [ ] Find the discussion of the release (e.g. https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/discussions/1401 ) and edit the title to include the new bugfix release, announce your intend there 
```
We plan to do a <bugfixversion> release soon, if there is anything one likes to getting backported please open a PR that targets the <releasebranch> branch.
```
- [ ] Probabbly backport offerd PRs if not already merged and identify possible fixes that should make it into the bugfix release

### Perform the bugfix release

- [ ] Switch to the release branch `tycho-N.M.x` (e.g. `tycho-4.0.x`) 
- [ ] Update version to remove `-SNAPSHOT` to the bugfix version with `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<BUGFIX_VERSION>` (**For Tycho version prior to 4 check the release documentation of that branch how to update versions!**)
- [ ] Review the version changes and commit (but do not push) the changes, e.g. with message `Update versions for release`
- [ ] make sure all tags are fetched with `git fetch --all --tags`
- [ ] Deploy to nexus staging repository with a fresh maven local repository: 
```
mvn clean deploy -Prelease -DskipTests -Dsource=8 -DjdetectJavaApiLink=false \
     -DforgeReleaseId=sonatype-nexus-staging \
     -DforgeReleaseUrl=https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/ \
     -Dgpg.keyname=<your e-mail of pgpg key> \
     -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/tycho-release
```
- [ ] [Publish the staged release](#publish-the-staged-release)
- [ ] `git tag tycho-<BUGFIX_VERSION>`
- [ ] [Publish the sitedoc](#publish-the-sitedoc) for the release
- [ ] Update version to the next bugfix version with `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<NEXT_BUGFIX_VERSION>-SNAPSHOT` (**For Tycho version prior to 4 check the release documentation of that branch how to update versions!**)
- [ ] review, add and commit the changes e.g. with message `Prepare for next version`
- [ ] push the branch
- [ ] push the tag `git push origin tycho-<TYCHO_VERSION>`
- [ ] [Prepare the announcment text](#prepare-the-announcment-text)
- [ ] [Create a release](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/releases/new) using the created tag and prepared text
- [ ] Also post this in the release discussion
- [ ] Forward the above text to tycho-dev@eclipse.org
- [ ] Optionally, announce on other medias (Twitter, ...)

## Publish the staged release

- [ ] Inspect the staged content if it looks sane
- [ ] close the staging repository on https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories

- [ ] Wait until all checks are done (this takes some time, see Activity tab).
- [ ] If all checks have passed, release the repository.

- [ ] Wait for artifacts to be available on Maven central, e.g. by looking at https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/tycho/tycho-core/

## Publish the sitedoc

- [ ] Generate site docs using `mvn install site site:stage -DskipTests -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/tycho-release` and check the result from `target/staging` seems viable.
- [ ] checkout (or update) https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/eclipse-tycho.github.io
- [ ] create a new folder for the release and copy the contents of from the `target/staging` folder into this
- [ ] in `docs/index.html` add a new entry for the created folder and check in a brwoser that everything works and seems viable.
- [ ] If applicabale update the symbolic link for the `latest` folder (on windows you must edit the link file with a text editor)
```
eclipse-tycho.github.io/doc$ rm latest
eclipse-tycho.github.io/doc$ ln -s <current release> latest
```
- [ ] add, commit and push your changes

## Prepare the announcment text
 - [ ] Find out who contributed to the release:
```
git log --pretty=format:%an tycho-<previousVersion>..tycho-<newVersion> | sort | uniq
git log --grep="Also-[bB]y:" tycho-<previousVersion>..tycho-<newVersion> | grep -i also-by | sed -e 's/.*Also-[bB]y:\s*\(.*\)/\1/' | sort | uniq
```
   - [ ] Find out who has sponsored something in this release:
   ```
   is:closed is:issue label:sponsored milestone:<version mile stone> 
   ```
   - [ ] Copy and update the follwoing text:
```
Subject: Tycho <VERSION> is released

Tycho <VERSION> has been released and is available from Maven Central repository.
