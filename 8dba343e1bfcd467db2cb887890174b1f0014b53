I\u0027d like something more precise for Tycho to not surprise the audience in any way.\nThe fact that we turn a plain jar to an OSGi bundle is not so internal as it\u0027s going to leak in dependency resolution and even delivered p2 repos or RCP products. I also believe we shouldn\u0027t try to hide nor blur wat is actually done.
