      "message": "I\u0027m not aware of an String::of method, but regardless, doing this change would have a few (unwanted?) consequences:\n\n1. Products that today rely on \"null\" value for one of os, ws, arch would, with your approach, be different. That means that the produced artifact would have a different name and this would break builds, right?\n2. If none of them are defined, it would mean that the artifact would replace the main artifact of the build, right? Or is this so unlikely to happen?\n3. The placement of the values in the string form would make it possible to distinguish os\u003dwin32 from ws\u003dwin32, but maybe that does not matter?",

      "message": "Sorry, I meant Stream.of(...).\n1. Yes, name would be different. I\u0027m not sure about broken builds though. Another possibility is `env \u003d\u003d null ? \"\" : ...`\n2. What\u0027s the main artifact in this context? How would it be replaced? The artifact here is supposed to contain the product id and/or the attachId, so I don\u0027t think the missing os/ws/arch suffix can close a collision. Am I missing something\n3. I think it doesn\u0027t matter ;)",
