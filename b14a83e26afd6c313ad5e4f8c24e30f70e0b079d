      "message": "I\u0027m not completely sure, but from the code it seems you can call the version-plugin either on a directory or on a file.\n\nSo the basedir is either a directory or a files. If it is a file, then its folder is used for further processing.\n\nBecuase the code assumed before that the file is always called \"pom.xml\" these check makes sure it only reads files that contain a pom.xml and skips other.\n\nThe problem is, that then a NPE occurs later on (I added a check for that in this change), so I suspect that was either of no use at all (hypothetical use-case) or has worked in an older version and got broken somewhere without getting noticed by any user.\n\nThats why I decided to remove the case because now we don\u0027t hard-code pom.xml for finding the pom, and added a useful exception on that place where before the NPE occurs if someone is still using it in a way where we still can\u0027t find a pom.",
