      "message": "The File interna are mostly string based so that would not make much of a difference.\n\nThe clearing of the directory was a no-op because the directory was never used anyways. I see no reason to introduce this now.\nThe directory we are using now is inside the target dir of maven anyways. So a proper mvn clean othergoal will get rid of it now correctly already.",
