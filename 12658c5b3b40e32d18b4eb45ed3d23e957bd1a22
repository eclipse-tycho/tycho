      "message": "this looks dangerous to me (what if testng has e.g. properties files or other non-class files?)\n\nwhat I understood is that you want to filter out certain files, so rather use excludes here?\n\nAs I see ti we have two options:\n\n1. Either provide a real testNG bundle that also works at runtime \n\nor\n\n2. just to make dependency resolution happy, provide an empty \"bogus\" bundle that exports the two testng packages that are required. Since there is no actual compilation happening against these packages, no need to provide a real testNG bundle.",

      "message": "I think we have to go with 2) because I requested the CQ only for testing propose and it was approved excluding the jquery.js file. That was also the reason why I unpacked the testng and removed that file. \nLongterm it might be helpful to file a new CQ and also a request to add the TestNG jar to the Orbit project so that we can just reference the TestNG bundle. \nThe next patchset contains a \"bogus\" bundle that just exports the two required packages to make the build process happy. \n\nFor the ITs I am still building a TestNG bundle to \"OSGIify\" the TestNG jar as part of the TestNG Test. \nIf you think I should to it not the way you mentioned above by using the \"publish-features-and-bundles\" goal I can do that but what would be the benefit in doing it that way? To have a TestNG update site that can be used by different IT Tests?",
