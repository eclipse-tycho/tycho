# Releasing Tycho

This describes the steps to perform a release of Tycho:

- [ ] Make sure all fixed issues and merged PRs have the correct milestone for this release, to finding PRs without milestone you can use the following filter `is:pr is:merged no:milestone` issues without milestone can be found with `is:issue no:milestone is:closed`
- [ ] Prepare the [release notes](https://github.com/eclipse/tycho/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md) which should provide a quick overview of new features and bug fixes
- [ ] Create branch `tycho-N.M.x` (e.g. `tycho-2.4.x`) for upcoming release and push it to remote; this branch should remain frozen until the release, only major fixes for regressions could be merged in before release. Work can still happen regularly on the `master` branch.
- [ ] Create release record on https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tycho projects.eclipse.org, link the N&N to https://github.com/eclipse/tycho/blob/[branch-name]/RELEASE_NOTES.md release notes]
- [ ] Update the Jenkinsfile on the `tycho-N.M.x` and adjust the `stage('Deploy Snapshot')` to reference the new branch in the when conditional.
- [ ] Update versions on `master `to future release with `mvn org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:set-version -DnewVersion=<NEXT_VERSION>-SNAPSHOT` and push to remote
- [ ] Announce the intent to release and request feedback about snapshots on tycho-user@eclipse.org and [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/eclipse/tycho/discussions):
```
Subject: Please test snapshots for upcoming <VERSION> release

We plan to release Tycho <VERSION> next week. For details of new features and bugfixes, see release notes [1].
Please help by testing the SNAPSHOTS build. To use it, change your Tycho version to <VERSION>-SNAPSHOT and add snippet [2] to your pom.

We plan to promote this release in one week unless major regressions are found.

Regards,
Tycho team
