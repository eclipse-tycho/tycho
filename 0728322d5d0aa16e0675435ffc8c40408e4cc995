      "message": "\u003e https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d531345\n\nYes, at the moment and only between M6 and M7.\nFor p2 M7, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d531345 gets fixed, and the product will be generated *without* the hard dependency on a.jre 9.0.0 unit, but instead with a capability requirement on JavaSE-9.\n\nBut, unless we make Tycho wait for Equinox M7, then we\u0027ll see products built with hard requirement on a.jre.javase/9.0.0, so we indeed need to keep it there in future.\nSo basically, addition of JavaSE-9 has to be hardcoded just like the 1.6.0 one.\nBut we could prepare it and keep adding LAST_KNOWN_EE too.\n\nSo when p2 and Tycho move to JavaSE-10 by default, then we could just update the LAST_KNOW_EE and things would work (as I imagine support for JavaSE-10 would come after Tycho updates p2 M7 using capabilities in product instead of req on unit).",
