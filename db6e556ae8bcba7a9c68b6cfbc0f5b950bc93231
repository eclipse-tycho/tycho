      "message": "Does the parent pom define tycho-version or individual projects can choose tycho version they use? I assume tycho-version is defined in the parent pom, in which case build failure is a better behaviour in my opinion because it will require immediate action instead of waiting until \"mysterious\" build failure due to the next eclipse mirror outage. \n\nAt the same time, I do not feel too strongly about this (and none of my projects use disableP2Mirrors anyways), so I can change the code to produce a warning if you still think this provides a better migration path.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think there is much gained with the error: most of our uses will adopt the new Tycho version by switching to the version of the corporate parent POM and in that way - unless they read the release notes - also silently loose the disableP2Mirrors\u003dfalse setting.\n\nAlso, an error would make it harder to test 0.16.0(-SNAPSHOT) with an existing version of the corporate parent (which is possible because the Tycho version is stored in a property that may be overridden). So I\u0027d vote for a warning only.",
