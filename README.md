# Getting support

Just get in contact with us through the [discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/discussions) and share your [ideas](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/discussions/new) or report [issues](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/issues).

Please bear in mind that this is a community project and not a product you contracted support for and as a result, some contributors may or may not look at your support requests on demand and if you do not provide the fix/implementation yourself, the issue might even never get fixed.

If you require dedicated help with Tycho or want to make sure a bugfix or feature is handled with priority, the following companies offer commercial support for Tycho

# Support Tycho  

In general, if Tycho is a key technology for your Organization, you can help with the following:

### Help testing
Test snapshots of Tycho early and often so that regressions are found early before we start the release process. This results in faster releases and maybe even more frequent releases if we are certain that snapshots are production-ready.

### Donate some time
Consider donating some developer time to improve code (e.g., fixing bugs), enhance documentation, help with review of open PRs, [answer questions on the discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/discussions), or [providing integration tests](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/wiki#providing-an-integration-test) to cover your important features.

## Sponsor individual contributors
If you want to help with the development of Tycho itself but can't afford to do it by yourself, you can sponsor some of the contributors of Tycho directly:

* [Christoph L√§ubrich](https://github.com/sponsors/laeubi) - A sample of his recent work can be seen [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho/tycho/commits?author=laeubi).

### Support us with processing power
Tycho has a very large user-base and thus we use exhaustive test-suites to ensure everything works well. This comes at a cost of also using a lot of processing power.

The following Organizations support Tycho by providing processing power for their builds:
* <img src="https://www.eclipse.org/favicon.ico" width="16" height="16"> [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/sponsor/) - host our CI Infrastructure, become a friend of Eclipse and support the Eclipse Foundation in general
* <img src="https://www.renesas.com/favicon.ico" width="16" height="16"> [Renesas Electronics Corporation](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMember.php?member_id=1069) - sponsors a resource pack with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM
* <img src="https://www.sap.com/favicon.ico"     width="16" height="16"> [SAP SE](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMember.php?member_id=665) - sponsors two resource packs with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM each
* <img src="https://www.redhat.com/favicon.ico"  width="16" height="16"> [Red Hat, Inc.](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMember.php?member_id=731) - sponsors a resource pack with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM
* <img src="https://www.sigasi.com/img/logoSquare.png"  width="16" height="16"> [Sigasi](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMember.php?member_id=990) - sponsors a resource pack with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM


If your Organization is an [Eclipse Member](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/exploreMembership.php) you can help us by [sponsoring one of the included resource packs](https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/cbi/wiki#assigning-additional-resources-to-a-project) to speed up builds. Organizations can check how many Resource Packs they have left for project sponsoring on the [membership portal](https://membership.eclipse.org/portal/login).
