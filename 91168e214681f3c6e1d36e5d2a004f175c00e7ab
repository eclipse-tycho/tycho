      "message": "I think this doesn\u0027t belong to that class.\nIe, is this the project that defines the file, or the project that the file is being \"applied on\"? Also, what about the case of the same file used on mulitple project? This would force to have 1 instance of TargetDefinition for each file while in reality, there could be only 1 TargetDefinition (the definition) and N \"resolved\" target definition.\nI liked the former TargetDefinitionContext, which I believe would be a good place where to host such module-specific logic. However, if just adding the project is enough, it could be an extra parameter to TargetDefinitionResolver.resolveContentWithExceptions() and part of the TargetDefinitionResolverService.ResolutionArguments.",

      "message": "There are two participants here:\n1) TargetDefinitionFile -\u003e that is a .target file parsed into a java object and this is the ReactorProject this target file resides in (the one mentioned in the target configuration).\n2) TargetDefinitionResolver -\u003e Resolves a given TargetDefinition and doesn\u0027t know about the source of it thus it needs a reference to the project.\n\nOf course it would be possible to hand this over via arguments, but as the ReactorProject has a 1:1 relation to a TargetDefinition it seems more natural to put it here instead of passing the information implicitly.\n\nThe same file can still be used for multiple projects and is (as far as I can tell) only resolved once in the lifetime of a tycho build.",
