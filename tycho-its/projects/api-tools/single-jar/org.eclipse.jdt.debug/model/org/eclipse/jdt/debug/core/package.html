<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides a set of classes and interfaces that implement a debug 
  model based on JPDA/JDI (Java Debug Interface). It provides a set of interfaces 
  that extend the base set of debug element interfaces to provide access to Java 
  specific attributes and behavior. This model defines and provides utilities 
  for creating line breakpoints, method entry breakpoints, exception breakpoints, 
  and field watchpoints. </p>
