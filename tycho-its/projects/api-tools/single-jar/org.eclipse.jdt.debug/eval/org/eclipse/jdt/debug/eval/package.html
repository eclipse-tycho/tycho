Provides a set classes and interfaces that support evaluations in the Java debugger.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

  This package defines a set of classes and interfaces that support evaluations 
  in the Java debugger. Two evaluation engines are provided - one that performs 
  evaluations by compiling and deploying class files locally for execution, and 
  one that performs an interpretation over an abstract syntax tree. The later 
  supports remote evaluation via JDI.
