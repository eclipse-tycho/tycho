Provides provisioning user interface classes that can be used for assembling
a provisioning UI.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package consists of several kinds of classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ProvisioningUI</b> is the hub of the UI.  It is used to access the underlying
provisioning session and its services, as well as all services registered by the UI.
It also provides utility methods that allow clients to create provisioning operations
or launch provisioning wizards.
</li>
<li><b>Policy</b> defines those aspects of the provisioning UI that can be configured
by clients.
</li>
<li><b>LicenseManager</b> describes a service which accepts or rejects
licenses and remembers the accepted licenses.  Clients should register
an implementation of LicenseManager in order to remember the
licenses.
</li>
<li>Various <b>pages</b> define reusable pages that can be hosted inside wizards
and dialogs.  In general, the pages are meant to be contributed by extension point.
In some cases, direct instantiation of the pages is permitted.  See the individual page
javadoc for usage.
</li>
</ul>
